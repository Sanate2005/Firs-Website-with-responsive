                <h3>Create a blog post subtitle that summarizes your post in a few short, <br> punchy sentences and entices your audience to continue reading.</h3>

                <h3>Welcome to your blog post. Use this space to connect with your readers and <br> potential customers in a way that’s current and interesting. Think of it as an <br> ongoing conversation where you can share updates about business, trends, news, and more.</h3>
                <br>

                <h2>Design with Ease</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="pink-text">“Do you have a design in mind for your blog? Whether <br> you prefer a trendy postcard look or you’re going for a <br> more editorial style blog - there’s a stunning layout for everyone.” </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Every layout comes with the latest social features built in. Readers will be able to <br> easily share posts on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, view how many <br> people have liked a post, made comments and more. With the Wix, building your online community has never been easier.</h3>
                <br>
                <h2>Create Relevant Content</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>You’ll be posting loads of engaging content, so be sure to keep your blog <br> 
                    organized with Categories that also allow readers to explore more of what <br> 
                    interests them. Each category of your blog has its own page that’s fully <br> 
                    customizable. Add a catchy title, a brief description and a beautiful image to the <br> 
                    category page header to truly make it your own. You can also add tags <br>
                    (#vacation #dream #summer) throughout your posts to reach more people, and <br> 
                    help readers search for relevant content. Using hashtags can expand your post <br> 
                    reach and help people find the content that matters to them. Go ahead, <br> 
                    #hashtag away.</h3>
                <h2>Stun Your Readers </h2> 
                <p class="pink-text">“Be original, show off your style, and tell your story.”</p>   
                
                <h3>Blogging gives your site a voice, so let your business’ personality shine through. 
                    <br>Are you a creative agency? Go wild with original blog posts about recent <br> 
                    projects, cool inspirational ideas, or what your company culture is like. Add
                    <br> images, and videos to really spice it up, and pepper it with slang to keep readers <br> 
                    interested. Are you a programmer? Stay on the more technical side by offering <br>
                     weekly tips, tricks, and hacks that show off your knowledge of the industry. No <br> 
                     matter what type of business you have, one thing is for sure - blogging gives <br>
                      your business the opportunity to be heard in a way in a different and <br>
                       unconventional way. </h3>
